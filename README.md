# ESTools

ESTools is a spring boot project, combined with swagger, to realize remote debugging of API.

This project mainly has two debugging interfaces, bool-query and Levenshtein. The bool-query interface is used to create simple Elasticsearch query statements. It can use Elasticsearch's four main control statements (filter, must, must_not, and should) to create Elasticsearch queries according to the user's width and depth parameters. The Levenshtein interface tests the algorithm to calculate the similarity of two String or integer arrays. This algorithm is also widely used in the full-text search functions of Elasticsearch.
